# Frontend Exercise

This is a sample project for frontend skills assessment in our frontend software developer positions.

# How to complete assessment

* You might want to peek into Angular v8 documentation, [CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) and [Material](https://material.angular.io/) packages before diving in

* Create a private clone of this repository. Make sure it is *private* as you do not want to show sloppiness by leaking company's fixed source code!

* Make a pull request against your new repository

* Write down how much time (hours, minutes) you spent on the exercise. This will not affect your application, but we will use this 
  to tune the hiring process.

* Send an invite to the repository to Github user `miohtama`

* I will take a look, make notes and let you know the feedback. There are two possible outcomes

    - You will be invited to a video interview and continue the hiring process

    - We will let you know that the exercise was not completed properly, but we might consider you for other positions 

## Pull request content 

Things I want to see a pull request

* What what was changed and why

* A screenshot of fixed issues 

* How much you spent time on it

# How to run code

The assessment is based on Angular 8 scaffolding. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
